        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hey there, I’m Zareen Khan, a passionate and results-driven Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) with over 10 years of experience as a DevOps engineer. Currently, I work at Cisco, where I’ve been part of the SRE team for more than 3 years, contributing to the reliability, scalability and performance of critical systems.

My professional journey includes roles at leading organizations like Comcast, McAfee and CVS Health, where I developed a strong foundation in DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms, infrastructure automation and system monitoring. This diverse experience has enabled me to tackle complex technical challenges and drive continuous improvements in system architecture and operational efficiency.

With over a decade of expertise, I’ve honed my skills in building scalable, efficient, and innovative solutions. Based in the vibrant California Bay Area, I am deeply passionate about technology and its power to shape the future. An enthusiastic and lifelong learner, I thrive on exploring new tools and methodologies, always seeking ways to improve and optimize workflows.

My commitment to sharing knowledge is at the core of my mission—empowering others to grow and succeed in their careers. Believing in the transformative impact of knowledge sharing, I strive to make a difference in society, not just through my work but by nurturing a community of continuous learning and collaboration.

I’m dedicated to driving operational excellence, fostering a culture of reliability and continuously learning to stay ahead in the evolving landscape of DevOps and SRE.</p>
